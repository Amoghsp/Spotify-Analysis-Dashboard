# Spotify Analysis Dashboard

**Project Title**

Spotify Music Analysis

**Description**

This project provides a deep dive into the top-performing tracks of 2023 on Spotify. Beyond just "total streams" this analysis explores the DNA of a hit song examining how musical attributes like tempo (BPM), danceability, and energy correlate with chart success across different platforms. The goal is to identify patterns that differentiate a viral hit from a long-term chart topper.
